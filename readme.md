# 1. Starting point

To help you evaluate this work, here was my starting point:

1. No knowledge of Java & of the Spring framework whatsoever.
2. Basic Backend understanding: I delved a bit into some sql / postgres / express.js, but that was for a week or two, one+ year ago and pretty elementary.
3. I worked full days from Monday to Saturday.

# 2. Process

1. I started to work on the backend, with the primary idea that I had to figure out how to make Spring send me a Json object that I could fetch on the frontend.
2. I found this somewhat old ressource: https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/how-to-develop-and-build-react-app-with-java-backend-c1e6c5c93ae
3. I started to follow/code the ressource on vscode but ran into tons of dependency problems of outdated libraries, build errors of classes and so on
4. I thought I needed a deeper understanding and bought the course https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/

Lessons after lessons I gained a better understanding of the ways to architect a spring app. More precisely:

1. Understanding the MVC architecture around the spring apps, as well as the terminology (Beans, context, annotations..)
2. Understanding the underlying role of the spring context, which creates all the connections under the hood, in particular the role of annotations
3. Got into dependency injection and inversion of control, the different ways to do it (constructors, setters, properties), learned about qualifiers, primary beans, spring profiles which help to architect the app
4. Learned about modules, and how we can split the project in a project.data and project.web for example
5. Learned a lot about Java, the POJOs, interfaces. Prior knowledge of Javascript was a great help.
6. Learned about thymeleaf, Maven and some other things from the Spring ecosystem
7. Learned to use IntelliJ IDEA

# 3. Conclusions

I had a blast. It was really cool to dive into a new language like Java and the Spring world. Anyhow I am really interested in the backend even though I am in the Frontend class :).

Unfortunately, I did not come to the point where I managed to return a valid JSON object to my frontend. (Moreover, I saw possible to get the backend to send me a random item but did not had time to try this).

I fiddled a lot with Jackson, stringifying, annotations, but I did not get to the point where it worked :(. I do "feel" though that it is not very far away and a couple of days might have done the trick :)

Thank you for the challenge. I put in all I got, was way out of my comfort zone (2-3 first days were really like a hike in the jungle at night!).

Yoann.
